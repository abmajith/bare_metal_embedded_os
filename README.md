# Bare Metal Embedded OS


The main goal of this repo is to construct an embedded OS either bare metal 
or hand-made embedded Linux and perform various applications. 
To discuss and understand the topic of embedded OS,
It is better to limit yourself to a specific *SBC*, 
we choose Raspberry Pi for cost-effectiveness and availability.
By understanding the core concepts involved in embedded OS, 
we can extend it to any other custom-created board.



Let's start with simple hand made Embedded Linux for 
*Rasberry Pi 3B plus* board on the page
