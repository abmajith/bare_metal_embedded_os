## Hello Interrupts


In this folder, we continue the hello peripherals program and extend it with interrupts.



In ARMv8 architectureâ€™s exception/interrupt handling is intricate, involving multiple exception types, levels, and states. 
To understand interrupts handling mechanism, we will list exceptions first, as it requires elaborate
discussion, I refer to the original <a href="https://developer.arm.com/documentation/den0024/a/Introduction" class="custom-link">ARM documentation page</a>
which is more practical than the ARMv8 reference manual (really big!).

As we know, *Ras pi 3b plus* has **Broadcom 2837** a **cortex A57 A profile** ARM processor, based on ARMv8 architecture.



## Execution or Exception Levels
![](exceptionsLevel.png)

As you see, the armv8-based architecture has 4 levels of exceptions.


- EL0 (User Mode): The least privileged level where user applications run.
- EL1 (Kernel/OS Mode): Where the operating system kernel executes and monitor user application
- EL2 (Hypervisor Mode): Used by hypervisors for managing virtual machines.
- EL3 (Secure Monitor Mode): Highest privilege level, used for secure monitor operations in a TrustZone architecture.




Compared to our earlier hello UART0, and UART1, here we have to do some changes in our start.S assembly file. 
To switch exception level from *EL2* to *EL1*, since it is ideal to develop our *OS* kernel in *EL1* level.

To find our current execution level we use the following C function

```C
unsigned int get_current_el()
{
  unsigned int el;
  asm volatile ("mrs %0, CurrentEL" : "=r"(el));
	// mrs is a special load function for the system registers value, CurrentEL is a system register
  return (el >> 2) & 3; // Two LSB's are not important here i.e el[3:2] gives us the execution privilege level
}
```

To do execution level transition, we will familiarize with system registers.

## General Purpose and System Registers

There are 31 general-purpose registers named *X0, X1,...X30* (62-bit width), the same registers can be used as 32-bit width,
if we refer to them as *W0, W1,...W30*. These registers are common for all four exception levels.

There are also several special registers.

Zero register *XZR/WZR*  (for 62 and 32 bits mode respectively), and program counter *PC* are common for all four levels.


There are Stack pointer registers *SP_ELn*, where n= 0,1,2 or 3 for each exception level (*WSP_ELn* for 32 bit mode). 
In the program when we refer *SP*, it refers to the current exception level stack pointer register by default.
This reference can be modified, but the level *EL0* can only refer to *SP_EL0*. I.e when a processor at exception level
other than *EL0* can refer to default stack pointer *SP_EL0* or *SP_ELn* depends the register SPSel, 
if it is one SP refers to *SP_ELn* else *SP_EL0*.


We have Exception link registers *ELR_ELn* (holds exception return address), and 
Saved Processor Status Registers *SPSR_ELn* for n= 1, 2 or 3.

I.e *ELR_ELn* store the return address.
Processor specific information stored in *Saved program Status Register*
-	*SPSR_ELn*[3:0] holds exception level.
-	*SPSR_ELn*[4] 0 indicates aarch64, otherwise it is *aarch32*.
-	*SPSR_ELn*[9:6] = *DAIF*, (Debug, Accesses System (Abort) Error, IRQ, FIQ mask bit)
-	*SPSR_ELn*[31:28] = *NZCV* (Negative, Zero, Carry, Overflow flags)

For an example in order to set the exception level to EL1 and access *SP_EL1*, and set the aarch mode in 64-bits and masking 
*DAIF*, we could set like this

```asm
	 mov x0, #0x3C5        // EL1h, AArch64, interrupts disabled
	 msr spsr_el2, x0
```

There are number of System registers notably our *SPSR_ELn*, *ELR*, and many others.


## Change of Exception Levels

-	The current instruction address should be saved in the *ELR_ELn* (Exception link register for current execution level *ELn*)
-	The current processor state (like exeception level, aarch mode, endieness etc) in *SPSR_ELn* (Saved program status register at *ELn* level)
-	Now call the *Exception Handler*, a subroutine program to analyse and perform appropriate actions.
-	Return (*eret* instruction) from the Exception handler and restore the program status by loading the values *ELR_ELn* to the stack pointer, and restoring the 
	processor state by accessing *SPSR_ELn*.


To change from exception level 2 to exception level 1, and manage everything within the *OS* level (i.e disabling hypervisor)

```asm
	ldr x0 #(1 << 31)
	msr hcr_el2, x0   // RW(bit 31) Execution state control for EL0, EL0 execute in AArch64
	// Set up SPSR_EL2 for returning to EL1
	mov x0, #0x3C5        // EL1h (to set up the usage of SP_EL1), AArch64, interrupts disabled
	msr spsr_el2, x0
	adr x0, startel1
	msr elr_el2, x0       // address to load after the execution transition to EL1 level
	eret // change to new exception level
startel1:
	// various initialization and kernel_main function
```




## Types of Exceptions
-	**Synchronous Exceptions**
	-	Will document them in future.
-	**Asynchronous Exceptions**
	-	IRQ (Interrupt Request): Standard interrupts from peripherals.
	-	FIQ (Fast Interrupt Request): High-priority interrupts that can preempt IRQs.
	-	SError Interrupt: Asynchronous aborts or error interrupts indicating hardware errors.



When an exception interrupt occurs, the processor must execute handler code which corresponds to the exception. 
The location in memory where the handler is stored is called the *exception vector* (or *interrupt vector*). 
In the ARM architecture, *exception vectors* are stored in a *table*, called the *exception vector table*. 
Each Exception level has its own *vector table*, that is, there is one for each of *EL3*, *EL2* and *EL1*. 

The table contains instructions to be executed, rather than a set of addresses. 
Vectors for individual exceptions are located at fixed offsets from the beginning of the table. 
The virtual address of each table base is set by the Vector Based Address Registers *VBAR_EL3*, *VBAR_EL2* and *VBAR_EL1*.


In order write the system based interrupt for counter or delay instead of polling type we have to use these *VBAR_EL1*.

Note: *EL0* dont have execption handler vector table, its exception should be handled by levels *EL1, EL2 or EL3*.
