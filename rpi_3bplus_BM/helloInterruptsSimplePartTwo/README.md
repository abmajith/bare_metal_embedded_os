## Hello Interrupts Hardware Controls


On this page, we explore how to integrate hardware components like GPIO pins with led, I2C, SPI module.

As of now I hardwired  the GPIO pins with leds and set up the counter 16, this project will be improved further, 
I am waiting for needed peripherals to test I2C, SPI.
